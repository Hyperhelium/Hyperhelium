# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hyperhelium,

I'm deeply curious about how the mind works and how artificial intelligence is beginning to mirror some of its complexity. My background is in psychology, and these days I spend most of my time exploring the intersection between **neuroscience** and **AI**.

I'm especially fascinated by things like:

 - How general neural networks and convolutional neural networks learn
- The architecture of large language models (LLMs)  
- The connections between biological and artificial intelligence  

I see AI not just as a technical field, but as a way to replicate **human cognition**, learning, and communication.

Here on GitHub, I'm documenting what I'm learning, experimenting with small projects, and occasionally building tools that bridge education and technology.

## ðŸ§  Interests

- Cognitive science & brain-inspired AI  
- Systems-level understanding of LLMs and CNNs  
- Making learning more human (even with machines)
- Making a true AI that replicates exactly human cognition.
